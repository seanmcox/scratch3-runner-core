# scratch3-runner-core
Definitions of basic elements of the emulator. The intention is to allow a scratch runtime to be implemented separate from opcodes, effects, etc. This should allow the emulator to be highly extensible. Definitions in this project are meant to allow interoperation between the runtime and the extensible Scratch language features.

Status: More or less ready. Review of tests needed. Functional implementation needed.

This is an Eclipse project.

See the `scratch-runner-main` for more detailed instructions.
